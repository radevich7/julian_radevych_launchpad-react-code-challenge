      <h1>How To Choose A University: 6 Tips</h1>
      <h2>1. Make sure you’ve chosen the right subject </h2>
      <p>
        It is fundamental to be 120% sure about your subject. You will spend
        your next three to six years studying it, and then the next 40-50 years
        working in the area. If you have doubts about your choice, read as many
        things about it as you can. Check job options, course contents,
        salaries; Google is your friend. But you definitely do not want to
        realize after two months of studying that you want to be a dentist
        instead of a mathematician after all…{" "}

      <h2>2. Consult university rankings </h2>
      <p>
        When I started searching for universities, I checked all the major
        ranking tables and calculated averages. There are some which give you a
        general ranking, while others may have separate tables for each subject.
        For me, the most important data was the student:staff ratio. The lower
        this ratio is, the better. In smaller classes you can ask questions and
        understand the topics more easily.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Find out what the university library is like </h2>
      <p>
        One of the most important things is the library. You will spend a decent
        amount of your life in the library, so it should be a comfortable
        environment. Another good point to check is whether there’s a 24/7 cafè
        for the early birds and night owls!
      </p>
      <h2>4. Check the course content</h2>
      <p>
        You can check the course content on the university website. If there’s
        an area within the subject you’re particularly interested in, check
        whether the university has it “on its menu” or not. Alternatively, you
        can contact the university directly, and I am sure they will be more
        than happy to answer any questions you have.
      </p>
      <h2>5. See what sports and societies are on offer</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you’re an avid footballer or love playing poker, you should
        search for societies and clubs in the university to make sure there’s
        something to match your hobby. All universities offer dozens (or
        hundreds) of extra-curricular activities, and it’s important to check
        these out too. University life is not just about studying!
      </p>
      <h2>6. Find out about the student accommodation</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re starting university, you will probably be moving away from
        your family for the first time. Therefore it is essential that the
        accommodation you live in is nice and friendly, somewhere you can call
        your “home”. Be prepared: you may have to learn how to cook, how to use
        the washing machine and how to do the washing up. And don’t worry about
        the room-mates, flat-mates or floor-mates. In my experience it takes
        approximately 2.5 days to be best friends with everyone in the shared
        kitchen.
