 Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-5.3`, `redux` and `redux-toolkit`.

One of the main challenges I ran into was using Thunk middleware in Redux to call RESTful API. This lead me to spend quite a lot of time browsing and researching about this feature of the REDUX. ALso I spend some time to understand Leaflet library for maps
